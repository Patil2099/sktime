    "**Example:** In the example, we will us the same airline data as in Section 1.2. But, instead of predicting the next 3 years, we hold out the last 3 years of the airline data (below: `y_test`), and see how the forecaster would have performed three years ago, when asked to forecast the most recent 3 years (below: `y_pred`), from the years before (below: `y_train`). \"how\" is measured by a quantitative performance metric (below: `mean_absolute_percentage_error`). This is then considered as an indication of how well the forecaster would perform in the coming 3 years (what was done in Section 1.2). This may or may not be a stretch depending on statistical assumptions and data properties (caution: it often is a stretch - past performance is in general not indicative of future performance)."

In `fit`, the composite algorithm uses a sliding window strategy to tabulate the data, and fit the regressor to the tabulated data (picture: left half). In `predict`, the composite algorithm presents the regressor with the last observed window to obtain predictions (picture: right half).\n",

The real benefit of Multiplexer is achieved When 'MultiplexForecaster' is used in conjunction with 'ForecastingGridSearchCV'.

This way, the process will first tune the hyperparameters of each forecaster and then return the best performing forecaster. This way, a pipeline of hyperparameter tunning and model selection can be processed by 'MultiplexForecaster'.
